Abstraction: Process of hiding the implimentation details and showing only usefull information to the user.

Example: ATM Machine

Ways to achieve the abstraction in java:

1. Abstract Class (0 %-100 %)
2. Interface 100%


1. Abstract Class (0 %-100 %) : 

* A Abstract Class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
* It can have abs and non abs method
* It can not be instantiated
* It can have constructor and static method also
* it can have final methods

2. Interface: 1. can achieve abstraction, 2. can achieve the functionality of multiple inheritance 

 * interface is always implemented by a class
 
 extends: class-class, class-abstract class, abs class-abs class, interface-interface
 implements: Class-interface
 
 
* A Interface must be declared with an interface keyword.
* It can have abs method
* It can have static method
* it can have default method
